### HIPE-2026: Evaluating Accurate and Efficient Personâ€“Place Relation Extraction

Following the successful evaluation labs in 2020 and 2022 on named entity processing, the third edition of the HIPE shared task will focus on **Person-Place Relation Mining in Historical Documents**.

The central question of HIPE-2026 is: **Who was where when?** Participants will develop systems to extract person-place relations from multilingual historical newspapers, a crucial step for building historical knowledge graphs, reconstructing biographies, and enabling new forms of spatial analysis.

### The Task

The task is framed as a three-way relation classification. For a given person and place in a document, systems must determine if a relation holds by assigning one of three labels: `true`, `probable`, or `false`. Two distinct relation types will be evaluated:

- **`wasAt`**: Denotes whether the person was ever at the place at any time before the document's publication.
- **`isAt`**: Denotes whether the person is at the place in the immediate context of the publication date.

### Evaluation Profiles

Recognizing the growing importance of computational costs, HIPE-2026 will feature two evaluation profiles:

1.  **Accuracy Profile**: Rewarding the highest-performing systems to push the state-of-the-art.
2.  **Efficiency Profile**: Promoting lightweight and scalable methods by considering a trade-off between accuracy, model size, and compute resources.

A surprise dataset from a different domain will be used to evaluate how well systems generalize.

### Registration and Information

More information on the schedule and registration will be available soon. For questions, please contact the organizers via our mailing list (link to be provided).

### About the Previous Edition (HIPE-2022)

HIPE-2022 was based on diverse datasets and aimed at confronting systems with the challenges of dealing with more languages, learning domain-specific entities, and adapting to diverse annotation tag sets.

The main **challenges** of the HIPE-2022 edition were:

- Multilingual corpora from different countries: English, German (AU,DE,CH), French (CH,FR), Finnish, Swedish
- Different document types (historical newspapers and classic commentaries)
- Noisy OCR
- Partial coverage of KBs with respect to historical entities
- Different annotation tagsets
